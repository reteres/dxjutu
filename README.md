	72、对你的思念一天天成长，对你的爱无时无刻的牵挂。无论飘泊在天涯何处，心里永远烙着中国印！
　　还有一个朋友，全家住在天津，他孤身一人来这个人和雪一样多的小县城办了首家公交车公司，也是在这一场猝然的大雪中，他的命交给了一辆疯狂的摩托车，交给了这个满街泥泞的的小县城。这一场事故发生在同事的叙述中，小县城有许多老势力，他的公司刚运营就受到了许多阻挠，他还有许多事情没有办完，但在这一场大雪中，一切只能草草收场了。他从天津到这个遥远的西部小城，好像就为了把命交给这里。我并不认识他，我之所以认他为我的朋友，是因为他和我一样，和这个小城有着太多的牵系。我也会这样呵，或者明天，或者几十年后，我也会睡在城郊的那片坟地里，我的躯体也会喂养出坟头的一撮撮青草，当然那是春天的事了。
我没有跟任何一个人性别。
Gradually grow up, you still like to sit on his father's legs, all the things still like carefully said to his father.
A accidentally, found on his father's chin with a red beard, the image of his father's beard is black all the time, so I did not hesitate to hand just pulled down, father was also jumped through the pain, I laughed.
At this time in a dozen years later land under the moonlight, I think this picture my eyes moist, as I remember, when my father jumped up and still hold me tightly.
At noon, and held his head, leather dog threw up his tongue, white rabbit lazy, like don't disturb them, just like the sun.
Only know branches, as if it can resist everything.
